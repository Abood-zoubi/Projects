#### Description:
Hello and welcome to my final project of CS50's introduction to programming with python when I was doing research to find what exactly to do for my final project I stumbled across many projects that did a simple Hangman game for their final project, or a Tic-Tac-Toe or a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, each seperately.

However i did not want to do like other people, i wanted to be special and do something that not many people can do and i thought why not do the three games all at once for my final project, and surely I started working on it. It took me like a month of developing and testing, and showing it to family members to test it. And to finally reach this final product, ladies and gentlemen i present to you the Boredom Curer

This project starts off by asking the user (which is the staff probably) if they want to greet the staff members, if the user answers with a "yes" or "y" (uppercase or the lowercase doesn't matter) it will ask for the name of the staff member you want to greet, if the user inputs David Malan it will greet him in a special way since he is the course main proffessor, if the user inputs any other name it will greet in a general way, if no name is given it will greet "." character in the same general way

Then after the greeting phase is finished it will display the name of the three games in the program and will allow the user to choose which game he wants to play first if the user is too lazy to type the name of the whole game it is enough to input the first letter of the game and it will run,if the user does not input anything or inputs a wrong value it will say "Invalid game. Please enter a game from the list." ,if the user wishes to play hangman first the program will run hangman by asking the name of the player and greeting him/her by hello, "their name" then it will hype the player up by outputing "Get Ready!!" and "Let us play Hangman" then it will ask the player how many chances does he/she wants to give themselve, this feature is just to make it more fun, if the user inputs a letter or doesn't input anything it will say "Please insert a Valid integer" and repromt again ,then it will choose a random words from the 10000 words in "words.txt" and display the word characters as "_" if the player guesses right it will replace the "_" by the actual letter of the word, if not it will deduct a point from the chances the player gave himself informing him/her that the guess is wrong and how mamy chances the player has left and repromt again to guess again, this will keep happening until the player runs out of chances, if the player gets the word correctly the program will say "You Won !!Congratulations (name of player)!!" and if not, the program will say "You Lose! Better Luck Next Time (name of player)" and will inform the player what the actual word was.

After that the program will ask the user he/she wants to play again, if the user answers with a yes or y (uppercase or lowercase) the program will start again from the beginning but skip the greeting part, and if not it will end by saying "Thanks For Playing!", if the user answers with a yes or y and chooes the same game again it will work without any problems but the repeat feature is added to allow the user to play all the games as much as they want

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed to allow two users to play not one, when the user chooses it, the program will ask the players about their names, where the first player will be "X" and the second player will be "O","X" starts first by the way ,after that the program will automatically print out the board and each playable spot in the board will have a significant number where the bottom left space in the grid have the number 1 (note: the numbers are invisible, I did not print the numbers on the board not make it cramped up ) and the box beside it will have the number 2, the one beside it will have the number 3, then to the row above, the left spot will have the number 4, the one next to it is 5, and so on.

The players can play the game by entering the significant number of the box they want to put their character in, if a player wants to play in a spot that already has a character it will inform the player and repromt again, same goes for if the player inserts a letter or a number higher than 9 or less than 1, then after 5 turns it will start looking for wins ,if a win condition is spotted it will end the game and say which player won and congratulate them and then as usual ask if the player wants to play again.

Now for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game it will have two modes single player in which the player will play by himself against the computer and the multiplayer in which the player can play with anyone he wants. Now when it is first run by writing "r" or "Rock-Paper-Scissors" (uppercase or lowercase) it will start by asking what game mode does the user wants to play, the user can type "s" or "single" or single player" for single player and can write "m" or "multi" or "multiplayer" or "Multi player" for multiplayer, if the user types an invalid answer it will repromt again, then it will ask the user how many times does he want to play, just to make it a bit more fun as some people like to play 3 times while some like to ply 5 times, some play only one time to settle some issue they have, if the user types anything other than an integer it will repromt again.

Now for single player the player can either type "r" or "rock" for rock or can type "p" or "paper" for paper or can type "s" or "scissors" for scissors (works for both single player and multiplayer) if the human chose rock it will show the user what the human chose and the computer will choose at random between rock and paper and scissors, if the human wins the round it will say "Human Wins This Round", if the computer wins the round it will say "Computer Wins This Round" and if its a draw it will say "Draw" then after the number of play the human sets before he starts playing it will calculate if the human won or the computer won or if its a draw, and tell the user the result

For multiplayer it works similar to the single player in how it works but the difference is that the computer will not play with the user but will have another user play along, now before it starts it will ask both players for their names to show which player wins the round and which player wins the entire game, the only catch is that in multiplayer players can cheat so it all goes back to the integrity of the players, or you can cover the terminal until both players type their play and uncover it to see the result of each round.

And then there is the "test_final.py" file which has some unit testing, nothing to explain here actually.

Thanks For Reading All This !! Hope You Enjoy Playing.
